# ToDue

## What is it?

It's basically a todo list. 

Originally I planned to implement it as a Rainmeter widget, but failed for all sorts of reasons. 

## What are the specialties?

- It is simple and concise
- It pins on desktop just like a Windows 7 gadget. Great for reminding people (especially me) that they have works to do
- It also shows the due dates
